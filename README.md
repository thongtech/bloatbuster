## ❓ Why BloatBuster?

**Manufacturers and carriers pre-install dozens of unnecessary apps on Android devices.** Beyond consuming resources and cluttering your interface, many of these packages include advertisements, diagnostic tools, and unconsented telemetry that collect and transmit your data. These apps can't be uninstalled through normal means, leaving you with no control over what runs in the background.

**BloatBuster identifies these packages and generates removal commands**, giving you control over your device's privacy and performance. With 1,600+ packages in our database covering phones, watches, and TVs, you can confidently remove unwanted tracking and bloatware without risking system stability.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Comprehensive Database** – 1,600+ recognised packages (~1,100+ legitimate apps, ~550+ bloatware) across phones, watches, and TVs from major manufacturers

- 🔒 **Privacy First** – Everything processes locally in your browser; no data ever sent to servers

- 🛡️ **Safety Ratings** – Each bloatware package rated as Safe, Caution, or Risky based on removal impact

- 📱 **Universal Device Support** – Works with Android Phones, WearOS Watches, and Android TVs from a single interface

- 📋 **One-Click Commands** – Generates ready-to-use removal commands with copy-to-clipboard functionality

### 🛡️ Safety Rating System

BloatBuster uses a three-tier safety rating system for bloatware packages:

- **🟢 Safe** – Safe to remove (bloatware, optional features, third-party apps)
- **🟡 Caution** – Review before removing (may affect specific features or UI elements)
- **🔴 Risky** – Advanced users only (critical system components that could break functionality)

### 📱 Supported Manufacturers

- **Samsung** – Galaxy One UI phones and watches
- **Xiaomi** – MIUI/HyperOS devices, POCO phones, and TVs
- **Google** – Pixel devices and Android One
- **Vivo** – Funtouch OS/OriginOS devices
- **Qualcomm** – Chipset-specific packages
- **MediaTek** – Chipset-specific packages
- **Carrier** – Network operator pre-installed apps
- **Generic** – Common bloatware across all devices

**Note:** The package database is based on devices and apps I've used over the past decade. It is not exhaustive and was originally developed for personal use.

5. **Select packages to remove:**

   - Packages are pre-selected if they're known bloatware
   - **Important:** Carefully review all pre-selected packages before removal. These selections reflect my personal usage patterns and may not match yours — for example, I don't use Samsung Dex, PC connection features, Android Auto, or similar services. Uncheck any packages you want to keep.
   - Recognised legitimate apps are not selected by default
